# Income-Status-Classification


For this machine learning project, we used some Supervised Learning Models such as Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. We got the best result with the Gradient Boosting algorithm by achieving a 90% success rate.

On Jupyter notebook, you can see the explanation for the project and comparisons of the models.
