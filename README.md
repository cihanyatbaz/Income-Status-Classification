# Income Status Classification

* For this machine learning project, we used some Supervised Learning Models such as Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree.

##  **The Goal and Dataset:**
* The dataset we used for this project is an extraction of 1994 Census database. It consists of demographic features such as age, workclass, education, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country and final-weight which is a combination of some features. Our main goal is to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.

## **Results:**

* After applying Pre-processing and other steps, we tried to get ROC-AUC scores for different models.

* In the end, we tried to get different scores for different situations.
